You still haven't told me what we're doing for my birthday tomorrow. I hope you haven't planned anything epic... or embarrassing.
It's your birthday tomorrow? Slipped my mind.
Mmm-hmm. As if you'd miss any opportunity to be devious.
Speaking of which, Dad says he'll be joining us for a few days in Venice at Christmas. Won't that be marvellous?
I'm glad you talked me into it. It should be so lovely with all the decorations and the ceremonies in the cathedrals. Blue tiles.
Blue tiles. Check the cars, David.
*gasp*
