I've been spending two hours a day in the tank. The results have varied. Sometimes I'm convinced I feel Laura's presence.
Other times I'm not able to get past my doubts. I still believe Laura is here. I do. Bergson, the philosopher, believed we choose our own reality.
If nothing else, I have done that. I'm having new equipment designed that should boost my sessions in the tank. That is all.
