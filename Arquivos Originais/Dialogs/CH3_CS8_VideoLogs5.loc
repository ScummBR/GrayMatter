Laura's presence in the house has continued. I've decided to begin a new experiment to study the effects of imagination. I'll use students as subjects, and my fMRI.
My hope is to record data on the areas of the brain involved in detailed visualisations. Perhaps using biofeedback I can train myself to stimulate the same area in my own brain and thus increase the power of my sessions in the tank.
This may, in turn, give more energy to Laura.
