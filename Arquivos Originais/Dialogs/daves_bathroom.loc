*inhale*
That smells like Laura. But it's not triggering any specific memories.
I know the smell, but it's not bringing anything up.
I don't remember this one very well.
No, nothing.
I can almost picture Laura in that tub. She loved hot baths.
I already had one today.
I just did that.
There's nothing in there now. Was Laura really here this morning?
Those are mine.
I don't need a towel.
Most items in here belonged to Laura. I've never allowed Stella to touch them.
