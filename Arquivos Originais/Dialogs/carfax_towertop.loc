There's a little box attached to the wall.
The box has a Daedalus Club logo!
I need to do something with this box, but I don't know what.
Looks like the bottom might come off... but how? Maybe it has something to do with those vents.
Fire! It worked!
It's a "piece of gold"! And the second paper looks like a coat of arms. Maybe it's a clue to the next location.
Pretty nice view up here.
That's not right!
