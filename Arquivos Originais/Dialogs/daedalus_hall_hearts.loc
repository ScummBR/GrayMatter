Ungh!
Geez. Look at this place!
Wow!
"Cherchez la femme".
I spent a little time in Paris... I think it means, "Look for the woman".
Apparently, I have to look for a woman.
Their hands are positioned oddly - like they should be holding something.
Each of the magicians holds a book. Which one is the real clue?
This must be a clue to using the Atlas statue to hold up the ceiling.
"The Game of Life"? It's another Daedalus Club game. I suppose I'm going to have to solve it to get around this basement. Great!
"To see what is hidden in plain sight - use the light." What light? The lights are already on down here!
It looks like I have to "win keys" from three queens.
These look like keyholes.
Some sort of piano. Or a harpsichord, maybe.
Très romantique.
That's the slide I came down!
But there's no way I can climb back upstairs like that. The trap door's closed.
Wow. I've seen some of these Venetian masks before. But that one's a real beauty.
Classical statues. Probably Renaissance. Really fits the mood of the room.
Some famous magicians' props. Impressive collection.
Well, without the keys, I won't be able to go in there. I need to find them.
Wow. That harpsichord looks tiny in this light. Nice effect!
So what's behind the door?
I don't have all the keys yet.
