Something strange has been happening. There have been several incidents that indicate a presence in the house - the presence of Laura.
It sounds insane, I know, but... there have been undeniable physical phenomena.
Is it possible that through my sessions in the tank I've given Laura the energy to manifest?
I plan to keep a careful record of events as they unfold. And there might be something in the field of psi research that could help. I'll look into it.
