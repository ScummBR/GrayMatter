"Centre for Cognitive Abnormality Research"? And this seemed like such a good idea last night.
I guess there's not much of a business in "cognitive abnormality" these days. This place is practically deserted.
From what Mrs Dalton said, Styles decided to retire and close the clinic. Maybe he couldn't find enough "abnormal" types.
I wonder what this clinic would have been like if it hadn't been for Laura's death?
The bus is that way. But I should at least see what Styles wants first. This assistant thing might not be a bad gig - for a while.
Cool house. A bit creepy. But I kind of like that.
It really is a beautiful house... Nice to have a place to come home to.
I think I noticed a plaque yesterday. I should have a look.
Looks like someone dropped the new "OxStu" publication.
