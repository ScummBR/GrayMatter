The riddle says "find the rabbit if you nac"... "If you can"?
I have a feeling whatever I'm looking for is in this tall grass somewhere.
There's something.
Well, I've come this far. A little dirt isn't going to kill me.
It's a white rabbit!
The riddle says I'm supposed to "enter the name of the mage". What's the name of the mage?
That can't be right.
Hmm. That is the name of the riddle. But it doesn't work.
Maybe I need to change it somehow.
I got it!
