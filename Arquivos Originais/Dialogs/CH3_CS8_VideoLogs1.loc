I've decided to... to try to keep Laura with me.
For years I've researched the possibility that consciousness, or mind, is not the same thing as the physical brain.
Since Laura's funeral, I swear... I HAVE felt her presence.
I've decided to spend several hours a day in the isolation tank visualising Laura. I don't know what will be the outcome. Except, probably, to indulge my own grief.
But... if any of her energy remains, then by giving it attention and focus, maybe I can lengthen its influence.
Since work no longer interests me, I've decided to make this my work. I will log the results.
