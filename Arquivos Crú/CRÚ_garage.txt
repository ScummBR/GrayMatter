Damn it! I'll have to leave it and find a bus or train to London.


I spent the last of my cash on that piece of crap.


It's no use. It's really, most sincerely dead.


If I can survive a couple of weeks here, I'll earn enough to fix this bike. It would be nice to leave here better off than when I arrived.


The bike will have to wait until I've got a bit more cash.


And it didn't cost me a dime. Wow. I'm not sure anyone has ever done anything that nice for me.


Geez. I'm such a freaking pushover.


The great and mighty lemon has been resurrected from the grave.


What the hell is that?


Lovely.


I don't know what that piece of rubbish is doing in my garage, but I'm gonna have a talk with Mrs Dalton about it.


I want that thing repaired. Can't have the girl getting stuck here.


I could make a run for it in the car. But I'd probably be busted before I'd gone 20 miles.


That can't be the car that was in the accident. Must be another family car. It doesn't look like it's been used much.


I think that's a Bentley under there. Nice.


Mrs Dalton has it serviced twice a year. I don't touch it.


Old family portraits. Laura took them down when she moved in. We meant to have them restored, but... it never happened.


These look old... and a bit mouldy.
