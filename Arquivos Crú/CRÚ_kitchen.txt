Go ahead, dear. Don't be shy about it.


It smells... amazing.


I didn't know how you took your eggs, so I made them the way I like 'em. But I can do 'em however you like startin' tomorrow.


I'm not picky.


Ta! One way's easy as another. People need a good breakfast, I always say.


Oh my god. These are the best eggs I've ever tasted.


Well, now! Himself does like 'em fresh. We've got a farmer drops 'em off every few days.


Bit peckish are you? What do they feed you over there at Oxford?


Oxford? Um... the usual.


And I never saw anyone in my life as cold, wet and tired as you last night! Hope you didn't walk all that way! There's a bus stop just down the road, no more than 20 yards. Takes you right to Oxford Centre.


Wow.


Still goin' on about them eggs, are you?


No, I just... can't believe my luck lately.


Well, before you go off, Himself left instructions for you on the door to the basement.


Himself?


Oh, I mean Dr Styles, of course. He's working down in the lab this morning. Doesn't want to be disturbed.


Now, I know you must have a question or two. Don't be shy about asking, Samantha.


It's Sam. But... Funny. I don't remember telling you my name last night.


There was a tag on your backpack when I washed your clothes. You really should update it to your Oxford address, dear. Wouldn't do having someone ship it back to the States if you lost it, now would it? And I'm Mrs Dalton. I did tell you, but I suspect you were half asleep at the time.


How far are we from London?


London? Hour and a half, I'd say. Car or train'll run you about the same. 'Course you'd never catch me driving in London. Not for a million pounds.


That's not bad.


Far enough away to be grateful, not so far as to be sorry. Or so the locals say.


Who all lives here?


Lord, it must seem a big, old empty place to you. Sometimes I forget. It's only Himself and me.


Just two people? In this huge old house?


He can't abide company.


Look, he can be difficult. I'll never say otherwise. But no matter what you've heard over there at that university, don't believe it. All I ask is that you make up your own mind.


If you can do that, and not be faint of heart, you'll be all right.


OK.


But whatever you do... don't mention the accident.


I saw a plaque by the door... "Centre for Cognitive Abnormality Research"? What does that mean... exactly?


The Centre was Dr Styles' idea. He started it with his friend, Dr Helborn. How excited they were! It was busy, too. Or starting to be...


Then something happened, and... well, he closed it.


But what does that mean - cognitive abnormality?


Didn't that school tell you anything? Dr Styles worked with patients who had strokes or brain injuries and the like. Always said those kinds of cases helped him understand the workings of the brain better than lookin' at a healthy one.


He's retired now?


You could say that. Hasn't seen patients in years.


I noticed the painting on the stairway. Beautiful girl. Is that Dr Styles's daughter?


If you want to get along in this house, that's the sort of thing you don't ask. Ever.


Right. Sorry.


So... What, exactly, does Dr Styles's assistant do around here? I mean, as you see it?


Never had one before. I'm sure they told you at the student employment office. It's mainly paperwork he wants done, files sorted, computer work, things of that sort. You should have plenty of time to keep up with your studies.


I told them there's no use sending over a medical student. He'd never let you touch his actual work. I take it you're not in the sciences.


Was it the tattoos that gave me away?


No offence, dear. What is it that you study?


Um... English Lit.


Well, that's all right then, isn't it? Now, I wanted to ask - will you be wanting the room, or will you be staying at the university?


The room?


The room you were in last night. It's yours whenever you want it. It's empty otherwise, isn't it?


Tempting.


Meals, too. If you're late, I'll leave your dinner in the fridge. I'm sure a girl like you knows how to use a microwave.


Sure.


I know they told me this at university, but I'm not sure I remember it correctly. Besides the room and board, the position pays...?


Well, I never! Catch a fever last night, did you? I'd have thought that'd be the first thing on a student's mind.


Sure! But I was looking at a whole list of available jobs. And I'm afraid I might be confusing them.


Fifty pounds.


Right! That's what I thought. Thanks!


You know, before I came to Oxford, I would have never imagined there was so much uninhabited countryside so... near by.


Oh, there's plenty of country around here. And thank heavens for it.


How long does the bus take to get into Oxford Centre?


Thirty minutes, like. Makes a lot of stops on the way. By the by, what college are you in? Did the student employment office say it was St Edmund Hall? Or am I thinking of something else?


Mmm... It is St Edmund Hall.


Nice college, from what I've heard.


Hmm.


I have a problem. Dr Styles asked me to leave my cell phone number with you. But I don't have one.


Oh. Take mine. My sister's the only one who ever calls me on it, and she's on holiday.


Are you sure? Thank you. I had one, but there was this incident with a ground squirrel. Ugly.


They can be nasty blighters, can't they?


Mmm. That was great. Thank you. Can I help clean up?


Ta, no! Off you go now. I'm sure you've a busy day.


OK. Thanks again, Mrs Dalton.


Ah, you're up! I was about to go an' wake you.


Good morning, Mrs Dalton. Smells wonderful!


So... You're still here, then?


Still here!


You got on all right with Dr Styles?


He's a toad. But I've dealt with worse. It's fine.


Glad I am to hear it! He needs things done, and seems like you could use the job.


Why? Did he say something about me?


Not to me. He's not even up yet. He doesn't sleep at night, you know. Sometimes I don't see a lick of him before noon.


Sorry to hear that. Did he leave instructions for me?


Well, he might have done, down in the lab. Oh, and someone left this paper on the step this morning. Must have been a mistake. We don't take a paper. You have it if you like.


Thanks. Mmmm. That was delicious.


Did you hear the phone a little bit ago? I thought I heard it, but I was in the pantry.


The phone? No. I'm pretty sure it hasn't rung since I've been back.


Ta. Flight of fancy, then. Never mind.


I... I just found out what happened to Laura.


Everyone knows about the tragedy.


Well, I'm new to Oxford and I didn't know. I'm really sorry.


You didn't ask him, did you? I hope to heaven, Samantha, that you weren't asking him painful questions.


No. No.


Oh, don't! Poor man doesn't need to be reminded. Not that he isn't every day of his blinkin' life. But he can't stand people talking about it. That's why he won't let anyone come over here.


But this house is full of reminders! Laura's pictures are everywhere. Even that calendar is still set to 2002!


He won't let me change any of it.


I get it. He wants to be reminded of her, for his own self. But he can't bear to hear other people talk about it. Because there's no way they can possibly understand. And anything they say just seems idiotic.


Maybe that's right, I don't know. In any case, I'd thank you to avoid the subject with him completely. Doesn't he have enough troubles on his mind already?


Good morning!


Morning.


Tea and toast? Want it in the lab as usual?


Not yet. I'll eat later.


You need to eat, David.


Later, Stella.


As you say.


Is that girl lurking about?


You mean Sam? She went over to the university.


Good. Though a fat lot of good that does to my files.


So... What do you think of her?


Who?


Sam, of course! You are a bear this morning. She seems an independent sort to me. A go-getter.


Ms Everett certainly has initiative.


She's not been any trouble to you, has she?


Trouble! That girl has it stamped on her forehead in letters a mile high. Not that I can't deal with a chit like that.


Well, I hope she works out. That lab is in a state and a half, and I've got enough to deal with carin' for the rest of this old monster.


So you've told me.


Good. I have to admit, she did get a lot done this morning.


Did the university say anything when they sent her over?


Not particularly. Funny, I thought they said they were sending a medical student. But I told them that wasn't necessary and they must have changed their minds.


She's not a medical student. You'd think they'd have got that right at least.


I know. That's why I think they must have sent someone else. Do you want me to call them?


Doesn't matter now. We appear to be stuck with Ms Everett.


What is that piece of junk metal out by the garage?


You mean the bike? I saw that. I assumed it belongs to Sam. It's broken down, from what I can tell. That explains the state she arrived in.


It's a bloody eyesore.


Well, since no one ever comes to Dread Hill House, no one will ever see it, will they?


Don't get too attached to the girl, Stella. I don't intend to keep her long.


What do you mean?


What I said. I needed someone to sort some things out for me and help with this new experiment. It's very short-term.


But you can't just hire the poor girl and send her packing within the month!


I don't see anything "poor" about Ms Everett.


That shows how much you know about girls! She obviously hasn't got a pot to you-know-what in, or anyone much to care, would be my guess. You should have seen the state of her clothes when she arrived - like she's been wearing them for a year. She must be on one of those low-income scholarships, don't you think?


None of my business. The point is, I don't care to have a stranger in the house. The quicker it's done, the better.


Now don't go upsetting yourself. I just thought it might be healthy to have someone else in the house.


Stella.


I won't say another word on the subject.


Listen, ring the repair shop in town and have them collect that bike. Tell them to do whatever they must to fix the ugly thing.


Why, David. That's generous of you!


Can't have the girl getting stuck here, can I?


Have you... noticed anything unusual in the house lately?


What do you mean?


I don't know. Signs of a break-in or intruder. Or... just the presence of someone else in the house?


No, no! No, of course not.


You have seen something in the house. What is it?


I never said!


You're acting strange.


Now that's the pig calling the cow fat.


I want you to tell me.


I don't care to talk about it.


Please, Nana. Please tell me. It's important.


You only call me "Nana" when you want your way. Only ever did.


Please.


All right. It was two days ago. I was making your bed. I saw... Well, I thought I saw a woman in the mirror on the dresser.


A woman?


It was just for a moment. And when I turned, no one was there. It was my imagination playing tricks, and no wonder with how quiet things are in this house!


It was Laura, wasn't it? The woman you saw in the bedroom mirror.


We're not gonna start talking about ghosts in this house! It's not healthy, and it isn't fair to Laura's memory! Do you hear me, David Styles?


All right, all right. Relax.


Have you seen Samantha? I need to speak with her.


No. She's probably at Oxford.


Why is she never around when a person bloody well needs her!


What are you looking at? I'm paying her salary, aren't I?


I never said a word.


I did notice that you've gone out quite a lot today. You mustn't overdo it. See how it upsets you! And with Sam in the house and... other things. You mustn't push too hard.


I don't plan to make a habit of it.


Huh. Wonder where Mrs Dalton got to?


Is that mine?


None other.


Is there a fire this morning?


Some people don't eat when they're upset.


Upset? About what?


Um... just stressed, about classes.


Well, this might cheer you up. The repair shop dropped off your bike this morning. It's out by the garage and running fine.


Really?


Yes, really! You won't mention this morning's activity to Himself, I trust?


What morning's activity?


Thank you.


That was the best. Thank you.


Pleasure, Sam.


I can't believe Dr Styles had my bike repaired. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.


Oh, don't read too much into it. Money is one trouble he doesn't have.


Do you know that key? To the tower? I found it under a rock by the door.


The tower?


Yeah, the older tower out by the garage.


That old thing! That's an old folly. No one's used it in years and years. Not even when Laura was alive.


The key doesn't look that old.


Well, I don't know anything about that. I wouldn't mess around in there if I was you. Must be filthy as the devil.


Dr Helborn showed me the list of Laura's "appearances". Like the time I saw someone at the top of the stairs.


Well, he shouldn't have. It's Dr Styles' private business and no one else's. I should never have let him into that room.


But David needs our help!


What he needs is peace and quiet and not to be upset. He'd be fine if people would just leave him be!


But that's the point! Someone is doing these things to David - someone is faking Laura's presence.


Who would do such a thing? And how could they pretend to be his poor, dead wife, back from the grave?


It's tricky, all right. But obviously not impossible.


No one is doing this. The best thing we can all do is just not... acknowledge it. Leave the poor man alone, don't bring it up. Please, Samantha!


I'm not going to talk to him about it. Not yet, anyway. But... David is stronger than you give him credit for, you know. There's such a thing as expecting too much of someone - but there's also such a thing as expecting too little. That's not good for him either.


You don't know what it was like after the accident. You weren't here when they brought him home to this house for the first time with Laura... gone. You weren't here to listen to him...


He must have been in a lot of pain, with all the burns.


There, you see? You don't know anything about it.


Tell me about the night Sam arrived.


What is it?


Just tell me what you remember.


Well, it was storming that night. Driving rain. She was soaked and looked like death warmed over. A real vision, she was.


I took her upstairs to get her out of those wet clothes, and... Well, the next thing I knew she was on the bed. Sound asleep. Not a lot to tell, really.


What did she say? When you opened the door?


That she was the new assistant, of course. David, what is it?


If I puzzle it out, you'll be the first to know.


I hope it's nothing serious. I do like the girl.


Yes, well, the Trojans were tickled pink with the horse, too.


You're up early. Give me two shakes and I'll have your breakfast ready.


Can't. I'm off to Oxford right now.


At your age, you need a good breakfast.


I'll grab something at school. Thanks, though. You're sweet.


Americans.


I see you've already been out and about today. Do you want me to fix you a plate?


Not hungry right now. Thanks, though.


Good morning. How was your breakfast?


Fine. Is Samantha in?


She's at university. Would you like me to call her?


Actually, I prefer not to be disturbed. If she comes in, tell her that, will you?


Of course.


David? I noticed you've been out today. Is everything all right?


Everything's fine.


Hallo!


Hey!


Oh, hallo, Sam. Can I get you anything?


Not right now, thanks.


Hi!


Hello, dear.


David. Can I get you something?


No, I'm fine.


Hello. Everything all right?


Fine, thanks.


Don't mean to disturb you.


It's your house. You're welcome in the kitchen anytime.


You were with Laura and me since our marriage. What would you say were some of Laura's favourite places?


She loved that chair up in your bedroom. She'd have to have tea curled up there, with a book. And the back garden.


Mmmm. I mean further out. Not the house.


Your cottage at the lake. Oh, and that park - Timmons. The one that she did all the watercolours of. Oh Lord, she loved that place.


Timmons. Of course. Thank you.


Mrs Dalton, you didn't remove Laura's white dress from the closet, did you? For cleaning or repair?


Her white dress? The one from the painting? Lord, no! It was cleaned and put in that storage bag years ago. It's not there?


No. But don't... don't worry about it.


But... Who would have taken it? I mean...


It's fine. I'll take care of it.


That calendar is out of date!


Oxford Police Department. Gee, that's reassuring.


It's a card for a psychologist. Now that's a phone number I'd have handy. You never know when you'll go stark raving mad.


She seems nice enough. But you never can tell.


Someone modernised an old fireplace. Cool idea.


They're well stocked for just two people. I suppose there must have been a lot more living here, once upon a time.


It's a business card from Inspector Paiser of the Oxford Police Department. He was the investigator on the accident.


Is that flour? Mind if I borrow a little?


Been there.


It tastes better when it's in the pie crust, dear.


Haha! You'll be my friend for life if you're making pie. But I need just a pinch for something else.


Oh, take all you want, luv.


It looks a bit gloomy out there.


I'd better not. It might seem suspicious to Mrs Dalton.


I'd better find another way to open that letter.


Simon's business card with his phone number.


Is that girl lurking about?


You mean Sam? She went over to the university.


So... What do you think of her?


Who?


Sam, of course! You are a bear this morning. She seems an independent sort to me. A go-getter.


Ms Everett certainly has initiative.


She's not been any trouble to you, has she?


Trouble! That girl has it stamped on her forehead in letters a mile high. Not that I can't deal with a chit like that.


Well, I hope she works out. That lab is in a state and a half, and I've got enough to deal with carin' for the rest of this old monster.


So you've told me.
